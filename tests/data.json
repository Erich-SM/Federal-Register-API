Currently, in limited situations, VA may pay a portion of a VA beneficiary's monetary benefits directly to the beneficiary's dependents. This is referred to as apportionment of benefits. Most claims for apportionment involve complex issues of family law, issues that are best suited to the expertise and authority of state courts. VA claims adjudicators have limited ability to analyze these complex and fact-intensive claims, to include both technical expertise as well as an ability to compel participation in necessary accounting measures. When VA awards apportionments, decisions rendered can disturb state court support awards, requiring a state court to expend additional resources to revisit a prior determination. Finally, due to their intricacy, a significant amount of information is needed to properly adjudicate apportionment claims. While this information is typically already available to state courts, VA must attempt to gather this information from the VA beneficiary and beneficiary's dependent, which is unavoidably a time-consuming process and often cannot result in a comprehensive evidentiary picture. The additional time and effort needed to gather this information increases VA workloads and results in the potential for delays of all VA claims processes, to include apportionment awards. Because VA apportionment awards often conflict with the awards of better-situated state family courts and because VA lacks the authority and expertise to make fully-informed, accurate, and economically appropriate awards, VA is proposing to amend its regulations to discontinue making apportionment awards in most circumstances and to stop apportioning certain benefits.","document_number":"2021-21816","html_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/14/2021-21816/apportionments","pdf_url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-10-14/pdf/2021-21816.pdf","public_inspection_pdf_url":"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-21816.pdf?1634129121","publication_date":"2021-10-14","agencies":[{"raw_name":"DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS","name":"Veterans Affairs Department","id":520,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/veterans-affairs-department","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/520","parent_id":null,"slug":"veterans-affairs-department"}],"excerpts":"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its regulations to limit the circumstances in which benefits will be apportioned and to stop apportioning certain benefits.

Additionally, VA seeks to clarify SAA authority and jurisdiction with regard to approval and disapproval of any course, or licensing or certification test, and to clarify the adjudicatory outcomes available to an SAA when reviewing an approval application for any type of course (i.e., approval, denial of an application for approval, suspension of approval, or withdrawal of approval).","document_number":"2021-21496","html_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/14/2021-21496/state-approving-agency-jurisdiction-rule","pdf_url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-10-14/pdf/2021-21496.pdf","public_inspection_pdf_url":"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-21496.pdf?1634129121","publication_date":"2021-10-14","agencies":[{"raw_name":"DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS","name":"Veterans Affairs Department","id":520,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/veterans-affairs-department","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/520","parent_id":null,"slug":"veterans-affairs-department"}],"excerpts":"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend existing regulations to clarify State Approving Agencies' (SAA) jurisdiction for approval of online distance learning courses and distinguish such courses from ``traditional classroom'' resident..."},{"title":"Schools and Libraries Universal Support Mechanism","type":"Proposed Rule","abstract":"In this document, the Federal Communications Commission propose to update the definition of library in the Commission's rules to provide clarity regarding the eligibility of Tribal libraries and promote increased participation of underrepresented Tribal libraries in the E-Rate Program.

After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the bog buck moth as an endangered species under the Act. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species.
